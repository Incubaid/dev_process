# possible agile development process

a set of conventions how a development process can work based on agile methodologies

## agile

- we believe in agile development processes like Scrum & Kanban
- we beleive the best process uses lots of ideas from both


## kanban as a nice addon to Scrum

Kanban primarily follows four core principles (info from [link](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/july/scrum-vs-kanban))

- Visualize work
	- Create a visual model of work and work flow, so as to observe the flow of work moving through the Kanban system. Making the work visible, along with blockers, bottlenecks, and queues, instantly leads to increased communication and collaboration.
	
- Limit work in process
	- Limit how much unfinished work is in process and reduce the time it takes an item to travel through the Kanban system. Problems caused by task switching and the need to constantly reprioritize items can be reduced by limiting WIP.

- Focus on flow
	- By using work in process (WIP) limits and developing team-driven policies, the Kanban system can be optimized to improve the smooth flow of work, collect metrics to analyze flow, and even get leading indicators of future problems by analyzing the flow of work.

- Continuously improve
	- Once the Kanban system is in place, it becomes the cornerstone for a culture of continuous improvement. Teams measure their effectiveness by tracking flow, quality, throughput, lead times, and more. Experiments and analysis can change the system to improve the team's effectiveness.

### why can Kanban help as addon

Kanban: A Good Fit for Teams that View Work as Firefighting

Toyota production plants and Scrum teams exist to build product. The literature speaks of successful application of kanban in the service industry, analogous to firefighting or hospital emergency rooms. It's tricky to schedule your next fire unless you live in the world of Fahrenheit 451. 

Many development teams run in firefighting mode, often with "swooping" from the Product Owner during a Sprint. And getting into a discipline is hard: it's easy to want to be able to react immediately to customer change instead of integrating a request into the business plan, and it feels good to release whenever you see fit.
