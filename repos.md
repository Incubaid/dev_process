## Different Types of Repositories

Remember that we define two types of organizations:

- Product organizations ("prodorg")
- Project organizations ("projorg")

Each of the organization types come with their own typical repositories, as discussed below.


### Repositories inside product organizations

In a product organization ("prodorg") following repositories can exist:

- **home** repository
- Source **Code** repositories
- **Documentation** (GitBook) repositories
- **AtYourService (AYS) templates** repositories
- **Websites** (www) repositories
