## Github Milestones (DRAFT)

We are still struggling how to best use milestones, all feedback very welcome.

#### In Github Product Organization (prodorg)

- release nr or name of a product e.g. JS8.1  (from jumpscale 8.1)
  - used to organize work around a product release !!! 
- can be used in home & code repo's
- if different components make up a product & version is per product then this milestone name needs to be the same over the relevant repo's !!!
- this milestone is used to group FR & BUGS
- stories can link back to a specific milestone & issues in a repo
  - its handy to use a query to show e.g. all bugs of e.g. jumpscale8 repo and then link this 1 query to a story card in the projorg

There are maximum 3 milestones per prodorg repo

- 

DO NOT
- use timing milestones e.g. may16

#### In Github Proj Organization (projorg)

- a milestone is a time on which a company (organization) wants to deliver something 
- this can be e.g.
  - date to deliver a project to a customer (for a proj_... repo)
  - just a date to put a stick in the ground e.g. gen1_release which is pinned to a certain date
  - a certain month e.g. June
- a story can only belong to one milestone
- tasks belong to a story and as such also to a milestone

DO NOT
- use version milestones e.g. js8.1
