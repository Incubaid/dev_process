### GitHub or other Git management system

#### Organizations

Organizations are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real world organizations. They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams.

E.g. [Incubaid](https://github.com/Incubaid) is an organization.

#### Users

Users are personal GitHub accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories, public or private. They can create or be invited to join organizations or collaborate on another user's repository.

E.g. [despiegk](https://github.com/despiegk) is a user who has access to an organization or repository in an organization.

#### Repository

A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

https://github.com/Incubaid/dev_process is an example repository.

#### Issues

Issues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be labeled and assigned to a user.

Example: https://github.com/Incubaid/dev_process/issues
