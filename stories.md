Stories help us to organize our work, they need to comply to certain requirements to be effective though.

### Properties of a good story

A story normally represents the view of a person,
e.g. I as product owner for product X would like to see Y features to be implemented because ... e.g. customer Z needs this, or strategic, ...

- well chosen name
- clear description of what we want to achieve
- priority ( is a label : critical, urgent, normal, minor)
- milestone (only 1, when does this story have to be delivered)
- assignee: is the [story card owner](roles.md)
- effort (in days)
   - put as ```(effort:4)``` anywhere in body of story 
- a clear set of requirements or link to another document which has the requirements (in same git)
- a clear set of acceptance tests or link to another document which has these acceptance tests (in same git)
- links to are put as link to right url in the git repo
  - specs (in git)
  - prd if relevant (in git)
  - features or bugs which are related to it (milestone as used on specific repo)


### stories can constantly be re-prioritized
