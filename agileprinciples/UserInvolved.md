## Active user involvement.

It’s not always possible to have users directly involved in development projects, particularly if the agile development project is to build a product where the real end users will be external customers or consumers.

In this event it is imperative to have a senior and experienced user representative involved throughout.

A User are people who will use the product.

Not convinced? Here’s 16 reasons why!

- Requirements are clearly communicated and understood (at a high level) at the outset
- Requirements are prioritised appropriately based on the needs of the user and market
- Requirements can be clarified on a daily basis with the entire project team, rather than resorting to lengthy documents that aren’t read or are misunderstood
- Emerging requirements can be factored into the development schedule as appropriate with the impact and trade-off decisions clearly understood
- The right product is delivered
- As iterations of the product are delivered, that the product meets user expectations
- The product is more intuitive and easy to use
- The user/business is seen to be interested in the development on a daily basis
- The user/business sees the commitment of the team
- Developers are accountable, sharing progress openly with the user/business every day
- There is complete transparency as there is nothing to hide
- The user/business shares responsibility for issues arising in development; it’s not a customer-supplier relationship but a joint team effort
- Timely decisions can be made, about features, priorities, issues, and when the product is ready
- Responsibility is shared; the team is responsible together for delivery of the product
- Individuals are accountable, reporting for themselves in daily updates that involve the user/business
When the going gets tough, the whole team – business and technical – work together!
