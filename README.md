# Incubaid Agile Development Process

Incubaid is a Belgian incubator trying to deliver exciting infrastructure products in the market.
We work with a group of startups to deliver the most unique products (see www.incubaid.com).

The goal of this ebook is to describe a set of conventions how a development process can work based on agile methodologies. 

These ideas are opinionated but do result out of years trying to create good products and still maintain flexibility.

We invite everyone to contribute to this set of documents.
