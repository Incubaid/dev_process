## Tickets & Tasks & Bugs & Feature Requests


### What is what

- Ticket
    - an issue raised by a customer or internal employee
    - escalates an issue like downtime, performance issue, question, ...
    - Tickets are put on project repo's or support repo.
 
- Bug
    - issue of product
    - only raised by support person or developer (gig or external if opensource)
    - If customers see a bug they normally will create a ticket first and the support person will create a bug & follow up
    - is done on the code repository
    
- Feature Request  (FR)
    - raised by developers or anyone having interest in the code base (is done on the code repository), these feature requests are funneled & prioritized before they become story cards.

- Tasks
    - only used on ```org_repo's``` or ```proj_repo's```     !!!
    - the tasks are linked to the subject for which the task is (not the proj where people belong too)
        - e.g. if our legal council needs to help on a contract in ```proj_mauritius``` as example then the task is in ```proj_mauritius``` NOT in ```org_legal```
