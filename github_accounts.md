![](Screen Shot 2016-06-05 at 3.26.51 PM.png)

We define 2 types of organizations:

- Product organizations ("prodorg")
- Project organizations ("projorg")


### Product organizations

- Groups repositories related to the development of a product
- Typically code repositories or the home repository
- Examples:
  - https://github.com/jumpscale
  - https://github.com/openvstorage
  - https://github.com/0-complexity
  - https://github.com/incubaid
  

### Project organizations

- Groups repositories related to the management of projects, customers or sales
- GitHub is an amazing tool to support all kinds of processes, next to just software developement processes
- As you can see in the section about [project organization repositories](projorg_repos.md) we use GitHub for a lot of purposes
- There is no code in a project organization
- Examples:
  - https://github.com/gig-projects/
