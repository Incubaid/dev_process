## bugs & feature requests funnel

IN: BUGS - FEATURES ->

OUT: STORIES

### principles

- The idea is that in a code repo you log all the bugs & feature requests
- anyone can report bugs or feature requests
- the [productowner](roles.md) will sort through the issues & give them priorities (use labels)
- the bugs or FR's are grouped and planned to be executed (attached to milestones)
- there can be lots of milestones in a code repo, these milestones are used to link X nr of bugs/FR's to a story in the home repo.


### DO NOT

- plan work directly on FR's or Issues, this result in very bad planning

### WHY

- This forces product owners to think about organizing work & priorities
