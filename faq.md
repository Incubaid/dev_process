## FAQ

### what if FR or BUG spans more than 1 repo

#### for BUG
Suggest to report the issue in the repo which is closest to the issue and ignore the fact that another repo is also involved.
All will make sense later because this BUG/FR will be linked to a story later.

#### for FR (Feature request)

The high level FR can be put on e.g. home repo level. This is really more like defining your roadmap.

Suggest to use milestones & high level feature request descriptions in the repo "home".

The story can be the internal representation and ofcourse can still link to the FR on the home repo.

This is useful if you want to visualize your roadmap on your product account & keep stories internal.
