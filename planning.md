## planning

This section describes how to plan work:

### product related

#### step 0: prepare

- per company there is an organization (on github) = prodorg
- per group of products there is a projorg on github
- make sure all repositories are prepared
  - use our tools to set the labels, ... 
- make sure all people have access

#### step 1: roadmap / strategic planning

- in home repo
  - Readme.md  (```$homerepo/Readme.md```)
    - link to docs mentioned below 
  - create terminology doc  (```$homerepo/terminology.md```)
    - define all relevant terms to do with your products 
  - create components doc  (```$homerepo/components.md```)
    - define the components which make up the product
    - what do these components do
    - link to relevant code repo's
  - create roadmap
    - see [Roadmap](Roadmap.md) section 

- in org_development or org_research
  - define roles
  - define milestones (time based!)
  - explain why the milestones
  - define owners of the milestones

- in proj_...
  -  define owner (only 1 role = project owner)
  - define milestones (time based!)
  - explain why the milestones
  - define team

- telegram group (optional)
  - create telegram group with same name as repo prepended with short company name e.g. gig_org_development
  - make sure right people have access to it   
  - all relevant stakeholders & story card owners
  

#### step 2: story card preparation

- is an ongoing process
- create all story cards relevant for 1 or more milestones
    - put the story cards in the right milestones !!! 
- choose the story card owners wisely

#### step 3: stakeholder meeting (see [meetings doc](meetings.md))

- call stakeholder meeting to discuss milestone(s)
  - use telegram group: e.g. ```gig_org_development``` to announce
- when approved, announce over telegram
- when not approved do more of these meetings, go back to step 2 when required

#### step 4: milestone meeting (see [meetings doc](meetings.md))

- present milestone & related story cards to everyone involved in the relevant organization
- this is the official start of getting this milestone done

#### step 5: story group meetings (see [meetings doc](meetings.md))

- the story owners organize meetings to discuss progress
- happens every day, needs to be very short < 15 min
- use telegram group: ```gig_org_development`` to coordinate
- use ```gig_story_$shortStoryName``` to communicate specifically about 1 story when this becomes relevant (is optional)

#### step 6: demo meeting (see [meetings doc](meetings.md))

- give demo's about what has been accomplished
- use telegram group: ```gig_org_development``

#### step 7: milestone acceptance meeting (see [meetings doc](meetings.md))

- discuss how the milestone went, learn for future
- use telegram group: ```gig_org_development``
