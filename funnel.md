## Bugs & Feature Requests Funnel

IN: BUGS - FEATURES ->

OUT: STORIES

### Principles

- The idea is that in a code repo you log all the bugs and feature requests
- Anyone can report bugs or feature requests
- The [product owner](roles.md) will sort through the issues and give them priorities (using labels)
- The bugs or feature request are grouped and planned to be executed (attached to milestones = version nr's)
- There can be max 4 milestones (versions+roadmap) in a code repo, so easy to attach bug or FR to a version

### How to link FR/Bugs to stories

- If you put $storycardname: at a prefix to the title of the issue then this bug/FR will automatically be linked to a story card.
- This only works if $storycardname is unique (which has to be for active stories)
- This is done by the Incubaid development process tools
