![](Screen Shot 2016-06-05 at 3.26.51 PM.png)

in this doc we will give it a short name: ```gitorg```

we define 2 types of organizations

- product github organization (prodorg)
  - repo's inside which are used to develop a product
  - typically code repositories or the home repository 
 
- project github organization (projorg)
  - repo's inside which are used to manage projects or customers or sales
    - github is an amazing tool to store all kinds of processes
    - as you can see in the section about repo's we use this for a lot of purposes.
    - THERE IS NO CODE IN PROJORG
