## GitHub Milestones (DRAFT)

We are still struggling on how to best use milestones, all feedback is very welcome.


#### In Product organizations (prodorg)

- Release number or name of a product, e.g. JS8.1  (JumpScale 8.1)
  - Used to organize work around a product release !!! 
- Can be used in home & code repo's
- If different components make up a product & version is per product then this milestone name needs to be the same over the relevant repo's !!!
- Milestone is used to group feature requests and bugs
- Stories can link back to a specific milestone & issues in a repo
  - Its handy to use a query to show e.g. all bugs or e.g. JumpScale8 repo and then link this 1 query to a story card in the projorg

There are maximum 3 milestones per prodorg repo

- Version number 1 (nearest to today)
- Version number 2 (next release)
- Roadmap (always use this name!)

- **bugs are NEVER but on roadmap**, following this page they are in version 1 or 2 after now.

- FR can be put on roadmap when not in one of 2 next releases, but no specific timing yet

DO NOT
- Use timing milestones, e.g. may16



#### In Project organizations (projorg)

- Milestone is a time on which a company (organization) wants to deliver something 
- This can be e.g.
  - Date to deliver a project to a customer (for a proj_... repo)
  - Just a date to put a stick in the ground, e.g. gen1_release which is pinned to a certain date
  - a certain month e.g. June
- Each story can only belong to one milestone
- Tasks belong to a story and as such also to a milestone

DO NOT
- Use version milestones, e.g. js8.1
