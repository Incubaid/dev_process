We define 2 types of organizations

### Product github organization (prodorg)

- Repo's's inside which to develop a product
- Typically code repositories or the home repository 

 
### Project github organization (projorg)
- repo's inside which to manage projects or customers or sales
- github is an amazing tool to store all kinds of processes
- as you can see in the section about repo's we use this for a lot of purposes.
- THERE IS NO CODE IN PROJORG
