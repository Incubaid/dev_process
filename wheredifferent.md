## We are not 100% Scurm Nor Kanban

- we have tried to capture many good ideas from both but our process is slightly different

### Stories are big

- In Xtreme programming stores are called user stories and are small, our stories are rather big and group related feature requests & bugs & tasks.
- Our Stories have a strict owner who makes sure the story gets executed.
- As such our requirements need to be well defined but high level.
- Our breakdown in small pieces is done by feature requests which are on repo level, but the story aggregates it.

### Scrum is no longer time boxed

- Here we accepted the Kanban mechanism where work is effort/process boxed not time boxed like in scrum.
- We create a milestone, appoint an owner for that milestone and then put story cards underneith that milestone.
- The milestone is managed using a Kanban board this allows stakeholders to see immediate impact & priorities.
- This is in strict contrast to scrum which is 100% time boxed per team.
- Milestones can go over teams.
