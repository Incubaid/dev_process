GOGS\nOrganizations\nOrganizations are a group of two or more users that typically mirror real world organizations. They are administered by users and can contain both repositories and teams.\nE.g. Incubaid is an organization (on gogs they are also called owners).\nIYO\nItsYou.Online\nGIG Identity management solution, integrates with GOGS and other GIG App's.\nUsers\nUsers are personal GitHub/IYO accounts. Each user has a personal profile, and can own multiple repositories, public or private. They can create or be invited to join organizations or collaborate on another user's repository.\nE.g. despiegk is a user who has access to an organization or repository in an organization.\nRepository\nA repository is the most basic element of GitHub/GOGS. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.\nhttps://github.com/Incubaid/dev_process is an example repository.\nIssues\nIssues are suggested improvements, tasks or questions related to the repository. Issues can be created by anyone (for public repositories), and are moderated by repository collaborators. Each issue contains its own discussion forum, can be labeled and assigned to a user.\nExample: https://github.com/Incubaid/dev_process/issues\nProduct Owner\n\na person who owns a product line from a technical perspective e.g. Jumpscale\na product line is an organization/account on github level e.g. Jumpscale\nthis person owns that account & will make sure all is organized properly\nsee roles for more info\nThis is not the product manager !!! Product manager defines product as how it fits for customers and works together with the product owner from engineering perspective.\nOwns an organization on github\n\nProject Owner\n\na person who manages a project\na project can be internal or with customers\neach project has a project repo (see types of repo's)\nthe project owner is responsible for the project repository and will make sure that repo is organized well\nsee roles for more info\nOwns one or more repo's (proj_...) on gogs\n\nProduct Manager\n\nOwns product from a go2market/commercial/marketing perspective.\nDefines roadmap.\nOrganizes stakeholder meetings.\nOwns one or more repo's (prod_...) on gogs\n\nvar className='atoc';"},"kanbanoption.html":{"url":"kanbanoption.html","title":"Kanban","keywords":"","body":"Kanban as a Nice Add-on to Scrum\nour methods are mainly using scrum methodologies but we added some Kanban twists to it.\nKanban primarily follows four core principles (info from link)\n\nVisualize work\n\nCreate a visual model of work and work flow, so as to observe the flow of work moving through the Kanban system. Making the work visible, along with blockers, bottlenecks, and queues, instantly leads to increased communication and collaboration.\n\n\nLimit work in process\n\nLimit how much unfinished work is in process and reduce the time it takes an item to travel through the Kanban system. Problems caused by task switching and the need to constantly reprioritize items can be reduced by limiting WIP.\n\n\nFocus on flow\n\nBy using work in process (WIP) limits and developing team-driven policies, the Kanban system can be optimized to improve the smooth flow of work, collect metrics to analyze flow, and even get leading indicators of future problems by analyzing the flow of work.\n\n\nContinuously improve\n\nOnce the Kanban system is in place, it becomes the cornerstone for a culture of continuous improvement. Teams measure their effectiveness by tracking flow, quality, throughput, lead times, and more. Experiments and analysis can change the system to improve the team's effectiveness.\n\n\n\nWe need features from both\n\n\n\nAdvantages of Scrum\nAdvantages of Kanban\n\n\n\n\nTransparency\nFlexibility\n\n\nImproved credibility with clients\nFocus on continuous delivery\n\n\nHigh product quality\nIncreased productivity and quality\n\n\nProduct stability\nIncreased efficiency\n\n\nTeam members reach sustainable pace\nTeam members have ability to focus\n\n\nAllows client to change priorities and requirements quickly\nReduction of wasted work/wasted time\n\n\n\nWhy can Kanban help as add-on\nKanban: A Good Fit for Teams that View Work as Firefighting.\nToyota production plants and Scrum teams exist to build product. The literature speaks of successful application of Kanban in the service industry, analogous to firefighting or hospital emergency rooms. It's tricky to schedule your next fire unless you live in the world of Fahrenheit 451.\nMany development teams run in firefighting mode, often with \"swooping\" from the Product Owner during a Sprint. And getting into a discipline is hard: it's easy to want to be able to react immediately to customer change instead of integrating a request into the business plan, and it feels good to release whenever you see fit.

It is contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary or master branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the \"live\" version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the master branch to publish your changes.\nClone\nA clone is a copy of a repository that lives on your computer instead of on a website's server somewhere, or the act of making that copy. With your clone you can edit the files in your preferred editor and use Git to keep track of your changes without having to be online. It is, however, connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two. You can push your local changes to the remote to keep them synced when you're online.\nCollaborator\nA collaborator is a person with read and write access to a repository who has been invited to contribute by the repository owner.\nCommit\nA commit, or \"revision\", is an individual change to a file (or set of files). It's like when you save a file, except with Git, every time you save it creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the \"SHA\" or \"hash\") that allows you to keep record of what changes were made when and by who. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made.\nContributor\nA contributor is someone who has contributed to a project by having a pull request merged but does not have collaborator access.\nDiff\nA diff is the difference in changes between two commits, or saved changes. The diff will visually describe what was added or removed from a file since its last commit.\nFetch\nFetching refers to getting the latest changes from an online repository (like GitHub.com) without merging them in. Once these changes are fetched you can compare them to your local branches (the code residing on your local machine).\nFork\nA fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original. Forks remain attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes. You can also keep your fork up to date by pulling in updates from the original.\nGit\nGit is an open source program for tracking changes in text files. It was written by the author of the Linux operating system, and is the core technology that GitHub, the social and user interface, is built on top of.\nMarkdown\nMarkdown is an incredibly simple semantic file format, not too dissimilar from .doc, .rtf and .txt. Markdown makes it easy for even those without a web-publishing background to write prose (including with links, lists, bullets, etc.) and have it displayed like a website. GitHub supports Markdown, and you can learn about the semantics here.\nMerge\nMerging takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another. This often happens as a Pull Request (which can be thought of as a request to merge), or via the command line. A merge can be done automatically via a Pull Request via the GitHub.com web interface if there are no conflicting changes, or can always be done via the command line. See Merging a pull request.\nAn organization holds X repositories\nPrivate Repository\nPrivate repositories are repositories that can only be viewed or contributed to by their creator and collaborators the creator specified.\nPull\nPull refers to when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.\nPull Request\nPull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum. See Using Pull Requests.\nPush\nPushing refers to sending your committed changes to a remote repository such as GitHub.com. For instance, if you change something locally, you'd want to then push those changes so that others may access them.\nRemote\nThis is the version of something that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com. It can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.\nSSH Key\nSSH keys are a way to identify yourself to an online server, using an encrypted message. It's as if your computer has its own unique password to another service. GitHub uses SSH keys to securely transfer information from GitHub.com to your computer.\nUpstream\nWhen talking about a branch or a fork, the primary branch on the original repository is often referred to as the \"upstream\", since that is the main place that other changes will come in from. The branch\\/fork you are working on is then called the \"downstream\".\nBlame\nThe \"blame\" feature in Git describes the last modification to each line of a file, which generally displays the revision, author and time. This is helpful, for example, in tracking down when a feature was added, or which commit led to a particular bug.\nGithub magic comments\nWe support some 'magic' comment that you can use in issue and help to manage story and tasks.\n!! prio $prio Set the prioriry of an issue. $prio is checked on first 4 letters, e.g. critical, or crit matches same\n!! p $prio alias above\n!! move gig-projects/home move issue to this project, try to keep milestones, labels. if it's a story, move all the tasks related.\nvar className='atoc';"},"github_accounts_repos.html":{"url":"github_accounts_repos.html","title":"GitHub Organizations/Repo's","keywords":"","body":"GitHub Organizations (gitorg)\n\nWe define 2 types of organizations:\n\nCode Organizations (\"codedorg\")\nProject organizations (\"projorg\")\n\nWhatever we describe can be used on github as well as on similar tools like Gogs.\nCode Organizations\n\nGroups repositories related to the development of a product\nTypically code repositories or the home repository\nExamples:\nhttps://github.com/jumpscale\nhttps://github.com/openvstorage\nhttps://github.com/0-complexity\nhttps://github.com/incubaid\n\n\n\nDetails in the section about Code Organization repositories\nAre always in Github.\nProject/Company organizations\n\nGroups repositories related to the management of projects, customers or sales\nGogs is an amazing tool to support all kinds of processes, next to just software developement processes\nThere is no code in a project organization\nExamples:\nhttps://github.com/gig-projects/\n\n\n\nDetails in the section about project organization repositories\nAre always in GOGS\nGogs versus Github\n\nWe suggest you use Github for all product related repositories, especially when you work with opensource software.

And I never see the same bug more than once.Often, we wonder how should we handle bugs when working in scrum/agile?The answer is 0 bugs policy. It is based on our experience in several of the Scrum teams in VMware Israel.Other ways we tried failed, with 0 bugs policy it just works.The following blog is a manifest that describes what is the 0 bugs policy and why it is the only way to go.The 0 bugs policy is an advanced yet very simple process for handling bugs.Whenever you encounter a new bug, you should either fix that bug, or close it as \"won't fix\" and don't think about it again. That's it. Simple.\nNow, let’s talk about why this is the only way to go.\nBugs can be generalized into 2 categories:\n\nBugs that were opened during the current iteration for user stories (features you are now implementing) - Fix them right away, otherwise the story/feature is not really DONE.\n\nIf this concept is not crystal clear, than this blog is not for you.\n\n\nAll the other bugs (regression, customer bugs, etc.). Non-sprint bugs.\n\nYou can either fix them right away (or in the next sprint; Poteto potato).\n\nYou can close them as \"won't fix\" - if the value of the fix does not worth the effort to fix it.\nYou can defer the bug.\n\nLet's talk about deferring the bug.\nJust DON'T. If you don't fix it right now, just close it.\nWhy?\nIt will cost you more to fix it later... a lot more... tons more!\nBecause a sprint from now:\n\nYou will not remember nor understand this bug as good as now.\nThe right environment - both for QA and for dev. – might not be available.\nThe code might change and the behavior will be slightly different.\n2-3 sprint from now (not to say the next release) you will not remember it at all and you will have to\nspend a lot of time understanding the bug and reproduce it.\nYou will need to maintain the deferred bugs, either if they are managed in their own backlog or part of the main backlog. You will need to prioritize them, and that takes time.\nAlso, it is annoying. Have you ever been part of a bug triage meeting? It’s a day-killer. Trust me.\nYou will never – and this is a known secret – fix this bug.\nIt will be in your system forever. Why?\nIf you have decided not to fix it now, it means you have more important things ahead. Features. Probably. Trust me. You will always have more features. Even in the next release (-;.\nAs the time will go by, you will defer more and more bugs, and then this bug will have to compete both against new and cool features and also with new and not cool bugs. So, if you didn't fix it now, when you don't have all the other important bugs as well, why the hell do you think you would do it later?\n\n\n\nOK. So we have agreed that the 0 bugs policy is in fact GREAT!\nOur conclusions\n\nEach product/code account has milestones defined = product versions\nPer code repo there are normally not more than 3/4 milestones\nVersion number 1 (nearest to today)\nVersion number 2 (next release)\nRoadmap (always use this name!)\n\n\nBugs are NEVER put on roadmap, following this page they are in version 1 or 2 after now.\nFR can be put on roadmap when not in one of 2 next releases, but no specific timing yet.\n\nvar className='atoc';"},"planning.html":{"url":"planning.html","title":"Planning","keywords":"","body":"Planning (#TODO: *1 document needs review, not ok)\nNOTOK\nIntroduction\nPlanning always happens in an organization repository, such as:\n\norg_development (engineering)\norg_support\norg_quality\norg_internalit\norg_marketing\norg_product\norg_finance\norg_legal\norg_hr\n\nRemember that organization repositories should only be created in GitHub organizations of type \"projorg\" such as gig-projects.\nAlso in case of planning related to product development, the planning should only happen in an organization repository, even while the actual code exists in a code repository, which can only exist in GitHub organizations of type \"codedorg\" such as jumpscale.\nSo in other words, for all product development there will always be two repositories:\n\nOne code repository in a \"codedorg\" organization where the actual code exists\nOne organization repository in a \"projorg\" organization where the planning happens\n\nAs a consequence you will have two \"types\" of milestones involved:\n\nA non-time based milestone in the code repository -

The theory is about the law of distribution and how many things have a similar distribution curve. This means that typically 80% of your results may actually come from only 20% of your efforts!\nPareto’s law can be seen in many situations – not literally 80/20 but certainly the principle that the majority of your results will often come from the minority of your efforts.\nSo the really smart people are the people who can see (up-front without the benefit of hind-sight) which 20% to focus on.  In agile development, we should try to apply the 80/20 rule, seeking to focus on the important 20% of effort that gets the majority of the results.\nIf the quality of your application isn’t life-threatening, if you have control over the scope, and if speed-to-market is of primary importance, why not seek to deliver the important 80% of your product in just 20% of the time? In fact, in that particular scenario, you could ask why you would ever bother doing the last 20%?\nNow that doesn’t mean your product should be fundamentally flawed, a bad user experience, or full of faults. It just means that developing some features, or the richness of some features, is going the extra mile and has a diminishing return that may not be worthwhile.\nSo does that statement conflict with my other recent post: “done means DONE!”? Not really. Because within each Sprint or iteration, what you do choose to develop does need to be 100% complete within the iteration.\nIt’s also worth considering the impact on user experience. Google has shown us that users often prefer apps that do just what you want. That’s just what you want. And no more. The rest is arguably clutter and actually interferes with the user experience for only a limited benefit to a limited set of users.\nSo in an agile development world, when you’re developing a brand new product, think very hard about what your app is really all about. Could you take it to market with all the important features, or with features that are less functionally rich, in a fraction of the time?\nApart from reduced cost, reduced risk and higher benefits by being quicker to market, you also get to build on the first release of the product based on real customer feedback.\nSo all of this is really common sense I suppose. But it’s amazing how often development teams, with all the right intentions, over-engineer their solution. Either technically, or functionally, or both.\nThe really tough question, however, is can you see up-front which 20% is the important 20%? – the 20% that will deliver 80% of the results. In very many cases, the answer sadly is no.\noriginal content from here\nvar className='atoc';"},"agileprinciples/ChangeIsNotBad.html":{"url":"agileprinciples/ChangeIsNotBad.html","title":"Change Is Not Bad","keywords":"","body":"Change Is Not Bad\nThis is in stark contrast to a traditional development project, where one of the earliest goals is to capture all known requirements and baseline the scope so that any other changes are subject to change control.\nTraditionally, users are educated that it’s much more expensive to change or add requirements during or after the software is built. Some organisations quote some impressive statistics designed to frighten users into freezing the scope. The result: It becomes imperative to include everything they can think of – in fact everything they ever dreamed of! And what’s more, it’s all important for the first release, because we all know Phase 2’s are invariably hard to get approved once 80% of the benefits have been realised from Phase 1.\nIronically, users may actually use only a tiny proportion of any software product, perhaps as low as 20% or less, yet many projects start life with a bloated scope. In part, this is because no-one is really sure at the outset which 20% of the product their users will actually use. Equally, even if the requirements are carefully analysed and prioritised, it is impossible to think of everything, things change, and things are understood differently by different people.\nAgile Development works on a completely different premise. Agile Development works on the premise that requirements emerge and evolve, and that however much analysis and design you do, this will always be the case because you cannot really know for sure what you want until you see and use the software. And in the time you would have spent analysing and reviewing requirements and designing a solution, external conditions could also have changed.\nSo if you believe that point – that no-one can really know what the right solution is at the outset when the requirements are written – it’s inherently difficult, perhaps even practically impossible, to build the right solution using a traditional approach to software development.\nTraditional projects fight change, with change control processes designed to minimise and resist change wherever possible. By contrast, Agile Development projects accept change; in fact they expect it. Because the only thing that’s certain in life is change.\nThere are different mechanisms in Agile Development to handle this reality. In Agile Development projects, requirements are allowed to evolve, but the timescale is fixed. So to include a new requirement, or to change a requirement, the user or product owner must remove a comparable amount of work from the project in order to accommodate the change.\nThis ensures the team can remain focused on the agreed timescale/milestones, and allows the product to evolve into the right solution. It does, however, also pre-suppose that there’s enough non-mandatory features included in the original timeframes to allow these trade-off decisions to occur without fundamentally compromising the end product.\nSo what does the business expect from its development teams? Deliver the agreed business requirements, on time and within budget, and of course to an acceptable quality. All software development professionals will be well aware that you cannot realistically fix all of these factors and expect to meet expectations. Something must be variable in order for the project to succeed. In Agile Development, it is always the scope (or features of the product) that are variable, not the cost and timescale.\nAlthough the scope of an Agile Development project is variable, it is acknowledged that only a fraction of any product is really used by its users and therefore that not all features of a product are really essential. For this philosophy to work, it’s imperative to start development (dependencies permitting) with the core, highest priority features, making sure they are delivered in the earliest iterations.\nUnlike most traditional software development projects, the result is that the business has a fixed budget, based on the resources it can afford to invest in the project, and can make plans based on a launch date that is certain.\noriginal content from here\nvar className='atoc';"},"agileprinciples/HowToEatAnElephant.html":{"url":"agileprinciples/HowToEatAnElephant.html","title":"How To Eat An Elephant","keywords":"","body":"How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time!\nLikewise, agile development projects are delivered in small bite-sized pieces, delivering small, incremental releases and iterating (we call them milestones which do consist out of X stories).\nIn more traditional software development projects, the (simplified) lifecycle is Analyse, Develop, Test – first gathering all known requirements for the whole product, then developing all elements of the software, then testing that the entire product is fit for release.\nIn agile software development, the cycle is Analyse, Develop, Test; Analyse, Develop, Test; and so on… doing each step for each feature, one feature at a time.\nAdvantages of this iterative approach to software development include:\n\nReduced risk: clear visibility of what’s completed to date throughout a project\nIncreased value: delivering some benefits early; being able to release the product whenever it’s deemed good enough, rather than having to wait for all intended features to be ready\nMore flexibility/agility: can choose to change direction or adapt the next iterations based on actually seeing and using the software\nBetter cost management: if, like all-too-many software development projects, you run over budget, some value can still be realised; you don’t have to scrap the whole thing if you run short of funds\n\nFor this approach to be practical, each feature must be fully developed, to the extent that it’s ready to be shipped, before moving on.\nAnother practicality is to make sure features are developed in priority order, not necessarily in a logical order by function. Otherwise you could run out of time, having built some of the less important features – as in agile software development, the timescales are fixed.\nBuilding the features of the software ”broad but shallow” is also advisable for the same reason. Only when you’ve completed all your must-have features, move on to the should-haves, and only then move on to the could-haves. Otherwise you can get into a situation where your earlier features are functionally rich, whereas later features of the software are increasingly less sophisticated as time runs out.\nTry to keep your product backlog or feature list expressed in terms of use cases, user stories, or features – not technical tasks. Ideally each item on the list should always be something of value to the user, and always deliverables rather than activities so you can ‘kick the tyres’ and judge their completeness, quality and readiness for release.\noriginal content from here\nvar className='atoc';"},"agileprinciples/FastButNotFurious.html":{"url":"agileprinciples/FastButNotFurious.html","title":"Fast But Not So Furious","keywords":"","body":"Fast But Not So Furious\nAgile development is all about frequent delivery of products. In a truly agile world, gone are the days of the 12 month project. In an agile world, a 3-6 month project is strategic!\nNowhere is this more true than on the web. The web is a fast moving place. And with the luxury of centrally hosted solutions, there’s every opportunity to break what would have traditionally been a project into a list of features, and deliver incrementally on a very regular basis – ideally even feature by feature.\nOn the web, it’s increasingly accepted for products to be released early (when they’re basic, not when they’re faulty!). Particularly in the Web 2.0 world, it’s a kind of perpetual beta. In this situation, why wouldn’t you want to derive some benefits early? Why wouldn’t you want to hear real user/customer feedback before you build ‘everything’? Why wouldn’t you want to look at your web metrics and see what works, and what doesn’t, before building ‘everything’?\nAnd this is only really possible due to some of the other important principles of agile development. The iterative approach, requirements being lightweight and captured just-in-time, being feature-driven, testing integrated throughout the lifecycle, and so on.\nSo how frequent is frequent?\nScrum says break things into 30 day Sprints. That’s certainly frequent compared to most traditional software development projects. We break things up in milestones which also happen each couple of weeks, it has the same goal as classic scrum.\nConsider a major back-office system in a large corporation, with traditional projects of 6-12 months+, and all the implications of a big rollout and potentially training to hundreds of users. 30 days is a bit too frequent I think. The overhead of releasing the software is just too large to be practical on such a regular basis.\n30 days is a lifetime!\nCompetitors won’t wait. Speed-to-market is a significant competitive edge. The value of first-mover advantage is potentially enormous. Whilst it’s not always the case, research shows that those first to market 80% of the time win; and end up clear market leaders.\nSo how frequent is frequent enough?\nA regular release cycle also allows you to learn more effectively. Your estimating might be good, it might be bad. Hopefully it’s at least consistent. If you estimate features at a granular level (ideally less than 1 day) and track your velocity (how much of your estimate you actually delivered in each Milestone), in time you’ll begin to understand your normal delivery rate. And when you understand this well, you’ll be surprised how predictable you can be.\nAnd let’s face it, managing expectations is really all about predictability. If people know what to expect, they’re generally happy. If they don’t, they’re not happy. Maybe even furious!\nSo, in agile development, focus on frequent delivery of products. And perhaps even more importantly, focus on consistent delivery of products.\noriginal content from here\nvar className='atoc';"},"agileprinciples/DoneIsDone.html":{"url":"agileprinciples/DoneIsDone.html","title":"Done Means DONE!","keywords":"","body":"In agile development, “done” should really mean “DONE!”.\nFeatures developed within an iteration (Milestone in our process), should be 100% complete by the end of the Sprint.\nStories on fixed should be 100% done.\nToo often in software development, “done” doesn’t really mean “DONE!”. It doesn’t mean tested. It doesn’t necessarily mean styled. And it certainly doesn’t usually mean accepted by the product owner. It just means developed. THIS IS NOT GOOD!!!\nIn an ideal situation, each iteration or milestone should lead to a release of the product. Certainly that’s the case on BAU (Business As Usual) changes to existing products. On projects it’s not feasible to do a release after every milestone, however completing each feature in turn enables a very precise view of progress and how far complete the overall project really is or isn’t.\nSo, in agile development, make sure that each feature is fully developed, tested, styled, and accepted by the product owner before counting it as “DONE!”. And if there’s any doubt about what activities should or shouldn’t be completed within the Sprint for each feature, “DONE!” should mean shippable.\nThe feature may rely on other features being completed before the product could really be shipped. But the feature on its own merit should be shippable. So if you’re ever unsure if a feature is ‘done enough’, ask one simple question: “Is this feature ready to be shipped?”.\nIt’s also important to really complete each feature before moving on to the next…\nOf course multiple features can be developed in parallel in a team situation. But within the work of each developer, do not move on to a new feature until the last one is shippable.

That approach is not so much Agile but Fragile!\nAlthough Agile Development is much more flexible than more traditional development methodologies, Agile Development does nevertheless have quite a bit of rigour and is based on the fairly structured approach of lean manufacturing as pioneered by Toyota.\nWe believe Agile Development teams can build better products if they have a reasonably clear idea of the overall requirements before setting out on development, so that incorrect design decisions don’t lead the team down dead ends and also so a sensible investment case can be made to get the project funded.\nHowever any requirements captured at the outset should be captured at a high level. At this stage, requirements should be understood enough to determine the outline scope of the product and produce high level budgetary estimates and no more.\nAn Agile Development team (including a key user or product owner from the business) visualises requirements in whiteboarding sessions and creates requirements and storyboards (sequences of screen shots, visuals, sketches or wireframes) to show roughly how the solution will look and how the user’s interaction will flow in the solution. There is no lengthy requirements document or specification unless there is an area of complexity that really warrants it. \nThis is a big contrast to a common situation where the business owner sends numerous new and changed requirements by email and/or verbally, somehow expecting the new and existing features to still be delivered in the original timeframes. Traditional project teams that don’t control changes can end up with the dreaded scope creep, one of the most common reasons for software development projects to fail.\nAgile teams, by contrast, accept change; in fact they expect it. But they manage change by fixing the timescales and trading-off features.\nStories can of course be backed up by documentation as appropriate, but always the principle of agile development is to document the bare minimum amount of information that will allow a feature to be developed.\nUsing the Scrum agile management practice, requirements (or features or stories, whatever language you prefer to use) are broken down into tasks of no more than 16 hours (i.e. 2 working days) and preferably no more than 8 hours, so progress can be measured objectively on a daily basis.\nOne thing I think should certainly be adopted from PRINCE2, the very non-agile project management methodology, is the idea of making sure all items are deliverables rather than activities or tasks.

Developers are much more heavily engaged in testing, writing automated repeatable tests to validate their code.\nWe recommend each story card to go through a validation phase though which is much more than testing, its executing the tests by separate people and make sure that the story has been developed in high enough quality.\nApart from being geared towards better quality software, this is also important to support the principle of small, iterative, incremental releases.\nWith automated repeatable unit tests, testing can be done as part of the build, ensuring that all features are working correctly each time the build is produced. And builds should be regular, at least daily, so integration is done as you go too.\nThe purpose of these principles is to keep the software in releasable condition throughout the development, so it can be shipped whenever it’s appropriate.\nBut testing shouldn’t only be done by developers throughout the development. There is still a very important role for professional testers, as we all know “developers can’t test for toffee!” :)\nThe role of a tester can change considerably in agile development, into a role more akin to quality assurance than purely testing. There are considerable advantages having testers involved from the outset.\nThis is compounded further by the lightweight approach to requirements in agile development, and the emphasis on conversation and collaboration to clarify requirements more than the traditional approach of specifications and documentation.\nAlthough requirements can be clarified in some detail in agile development (as long as they are done just-in-time and not all up-front), it is quite possible for this to result in some ambiguity and/or some cases where not all team members have the same understanding of the requirements.\nSo what does this mean for an agile tester? A common concern from testers moving to an agile development approach – particularly from those moving from a much more formal environment – is that they don’t know precisely what they’re testing for. They don’t have a detailed spec to test against, so how can they possibly test it?\nEven in a more traditional development environment, I always argued that testers could test that software meets a spec, and yet the product could still be poor quality, maybe because the requirement was poorly specified or because it was clearly written but just not a very good idea in the first place! A spec does not necessarily make the product good!\nIn agile development, there’s a belief that sometimes – maybe even often – these things are only really evident when the software can be seen running. By delivering small incremental releases and by measuring progress only by working software, the acid test is seeing the software and only then can you really judge for sure whether or not it’s good quality.\nAgile testing therefore calls for more judgement from a tester, the application of more expertise about what’s good and what’s not, the ability to be more flexible and having the confidence to work more from your own knowledge of what good looks like. It’s certainly not just a case of following a test script, making sure the software does what it says in the spec.\nAnd for these reasons, agile testing is not for dummies!\noriginal content from here\nvar className='atoc';"},"agileprinciples/Collaboration.html":{"url":"agileprinciples/Collaboration.html","title":"No Place For Snipers","keywords":"","body":"No Place For Snipers!\nAgile development relies on close cooperation and collaboration between all team members and stakeholders.\nAgile development principles include keeping requirements and documentation lightweight, and acknowledging that change is a normal and acceptable reality in software development.\nThis makes close collaboration particularly important to clarify requirements just-in-time and to keep all team members (including the product owner) ‘on the same page’ throughout the development.\nYou certainly can’t do away with a big spec up-front and not have close collaboration. You need one of them that’s for sure. And for so many situations the latter can be more effective and is so much more rewarding for all involved!\nIn situations where there is or has been tension between the development team and business people, bringing everyone close in an agile development approach is akin to a boxer keeping close to his opponent, so he can’t throw the big punch! :-)\nBut unlike boxing, the project/product team is working towards a shared goal, creating better teamwork, fostering team spirit, and building stronger, more cooperative relationships.\nThere are many reasons to consider the adoption of agile development, and in the near future I’m going to outline “10 good reasons to go agile” and explain some of the key business benefits of an agile approach.\nIf business engagement is an issue for you, that’s one good reason to go agile you shouldn’t ignore.\noriginal content from here\nvar className='atoc';"},"moreinfo.html":{"url":"moreinfo.html","title":"More Info","keywords":"","body":"More Info\n\nVery good site which explains 7 principles of agile development\n\nvar className='atoc';"},"tools.html":{"url":"tools.html","title":"Tools","keywords":"","body":"Tools\nWIKI/GITBOOK\n\nsuggest to extensively use wiki in markdown format to write\nstories\nissues\nspecs\n\n\nyou can use the amazing gitbook tool to convert the markdown docs to an ebook (see this one)\n\ngitbook editor\n\nhttps://www.gitbook.com/editor\n\nhow to use gitbook toolchain locally\nnpm update -g\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\nnpm install gitbook-plugin-mermaid2\nnpm install phantom\ngitbook update\nto serve local content\ncd $directory_gitbook_md_files\ngitbook install\ngitbook serve\nto create a pdf\n```\n\n\n- more info see https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/setup.md\n\n\n\n### plugins to gitbook\n\nbook.json file\n\n```json\n{\n    \"gitbook\": \">=2.0.0\",\n    \"plugins\": [\"edit-link\",\"googledocs\",\"atoc\",\"github\",\"gitbookcode\",\"chart\",\"image-captions\",\"mermaid2\",\"highlight2\",\"codeblock\",\"zingchart\"],\n    \"pluginsConfig\": {\n            \"edit-link\": {\n                \"base\": \"https://github.com/Incubaid/dev_process/edit/master/\",\n                \"label\": \"Edit This Page\"\n            },\n    \"googledocs\": {\n            \"rm\": \"minimal\",\n            \"frameborder\": \"0\",\n            \"width\": \"100%\",\n            \"height\": \"500px\",\n            \"noembed\": \"new window\"\n        },\n     \"atoc\": {\n            \"addClass\": true,\n            \"className\": \"atoc\"\n        },\n    \"chart\": {\n            \"type\": \"highcharts\"\n        },\n    \"github\": {\n            \"url\": \"https://github.com/Incubaid/dev_process\"\n        }\n    }\n}\nis example file to be put in gitbook (in root of folder), enables next plugins.\ntable of contents\n\nplugin\n\ngdocs inclusion\nsee link\nexample\nhttp://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key={key}&hl=en\nmermaid\nSEEMS NOT TO BE WORKING ON ALL SYSTEMS (e.g. on my OSX I can't get it to work, but on gitbook site it works)\n\nplugin\ninfo about mermaid\n\n\\{% mermaid %\\}\ngraph TD;\n  A-->B;\n  A-->C;\n  B-->D;\n  C-->D;\n\\{% endmermaid %\\}\ninclude codeblock\n\nplugin\n\n\\[import\\](fixtures/test.js)\n\\[import, lang-typescript\\]\\(hello-world.ts\\)\n\\[import:-\\]\\(path/to/file\\)\ndont use the '\\' in examples above\ninclude\nto include other markdown docs, ideal to avoid repetition\n\nplugin\n\n\\!\\INCLUDE \"file.md\"\ndont use the '\\' in example above\nzingchart\ndocs see\nhttps://www.zingchart.com/docs/\n\\{% zingchart width=300, height=300 %\\}\n{\n    \"type\":\"bar\",  \n    \"series\":[  \n        { \"values\": [35, 42, 67, 89]},\n        { \"values\": [28, 40, 39, 36]}\n    ]\n}\n\\{% endzingchart %\\}\nzingchart.render({\"id\":\"zingchart-1\",\"data\":\"\\n{\\n    \\\"type\\\":\\\"bar\\\",  \\n    \\\"series\\\":[  \\n        { \\\"values\\\": [35, 42, 67, 89]},\\n        { \\\"values\\\": [28, 40, 39, 36]}\\n    ]\\n}\\n\",\"width\":300,\"height\":300,\"__keywords\":true});\nvar className='atoc';"},"faq.html":{"url":"faq.html","title":"FAQ","keywords":"","body":"FAQ\nWhat if FR or BUG spans more than 1 repo\nFor BUG\n\nA bug can in principle only be linked to 1 repo, its always linked to the code inside 1 repo.\nIn case the same bug has impact on 2 repo's, which is exceptionall then file 2 separate bugs & define what needs to be fixed in the relevant repo.\nYou can link to related bugs in the other repo if this seems to be useful.\nSometimes it can be that a bug really requires a feature request.\n\nFor FR (Feature request)\n\nThe high level FR can be put on e.g. home repo level.

At Incubaid we have created some tools to be able to use our Github also as ticketing system but otherwise there are many of them. The support person in your organization can then create the bug report in the appropriate repo and link back from the ticketing system.\n\nvar className='atoc';"}}}
