## GitHub/Gogs Milestones

used to plan future.

### In Code Organizations \(codedorg\)

* Only use version nr's e.g. 8.1.0
  * Used to organize work around a component release !!!
* If different components make up a product & version is per product then this milestone name needs to be the same over the relevant repo's !!!
* Milestone is used to group feature requests and bugs
* Stories can link back to a specific milestone & issues in a repo
  * Its handy to use a query to show e.g. all bugs or e.g. JumpScale8 repo and then link this 1 query to a story card in the projorg

#### version nrs

* major 1.0.0
* minor 1.1.0
* feature 1.1.2
* build 1.1.2.333

#### There are maximum 4 milestones per codedorg repo

* Version number 1 \(nearest to today, major, minor or feature release\)
* Version number 2 \(next release, major, minor or feature release\)
* Version number 3: Optional: A major or minor version number after nr 2 \(only relevant when 1 or 2 are not major or minor\)
* Roadmap \(always use this name!, is for future work\)

DO NOT

* Use timing milestones, e.g. may16
* Use names

### In Project organizations \(projorg\)

* Milestone is a time on which a company \(organization\) wants to deliver something
* This can be e.g.
  * Date to deliver a project to a customer \(for a proj\_... repo\)
  * Just a date to put a stick in the ground, e.g. gen1\_release which is pinned to a certain date
  * a certain month e.g. June
* Each story can only belong to one milestone
* Tasks belong to a story and as such also to a milestone
* Only use following naming conventions \(no need to specify month nr's or year nr's\)
  * nov\_mid
  * nov\_end
  * q4
  * future
* PLEASE be consistent with the names used otherwise presentation on a higher level layer becomes dificult.

DO NOT

* Use version milestones, e.g. js8.1
