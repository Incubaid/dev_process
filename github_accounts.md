![](Screen Shot 2016-06-05 at 3.26.51 PM.png)

We define 2 types of organizations

### Product GitHub organization (prodorg)

- Groups repositories related to the development of a product
- Typically code repositories or the home repository 

 
### Project GitHub organization (projorg)
- Groups repositoris related to the management of projects, customers or sales
- GitHub is an amazing tool to store all kinds of processes, next to just code
- As you can see in the section about repo's we use this for a lot of purposes
- THERE IS NO CODE IN PROJORG
